      "description": "The Jordan Delta 2 offers a fresh, fearless take on the features you want: durability, comfort and an attitude that's Jordan to the core. We updated design lines and swapped out some components, but the idea is the same as the first Delta. The 2 still has that clashing combination of supportive and space age-like materials, with lots of different textures and heavy stitching to create a look that's both adventurous and iconic.",
